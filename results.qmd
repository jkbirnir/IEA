title: "Post-election information"

The below tables replicate Tables #... and #.... in the paper and include information on candidates and parties separately. Results for candidates and parties at each level and election are provided in a separate sheet in a .csv format and can be accessed by clicking on the pertinent link.  The information for a given level is standardized and includes election year, office and district identifiers.  For longitudinal analysis of multiple elections the information from discrete sheets can, therefore, be easily combined.
